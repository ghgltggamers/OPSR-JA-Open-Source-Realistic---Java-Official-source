## Why is OPSR-JA Almost double the size of any other resource pack?
OPSR-JA Follows a quality textured and photorealism way which already increses the overall pack size a lot but OPSR-JA also provides a built-in backup for linux based systems which doubles the pack size.


## How to backup OPSR-JA?
If you want to backup OPSR-JA then you must be using a linux based system because OPSR-JA Only provides backups for linux based systems only. You must be familar with CLI tools of linux and terminal of your operating system.

Suggested Systems :-
Debian
Ubuntu
Arch
Manjaro

Donot worry even if your distribution is different but if it is linux based then it may run backup program as well.

Let's suppose you are using a linux based system and want to backup OPSR-JA then follow the steps but do not follow them if you are using Windows or MAC or anything else.

Loacate the Pack file (Typically in "/home/[user]/.minecraft/resourcepacks/")
Extract the Resource pack file to a different location (eg : "/home/Documents/RP/")

Extract the pack.

Open the terminal in the extracted folder

Fire up "./pack_backup.opsrja" or the following command
```bash
./pack_backup.opsrja
```

and wait until you see "backup completed with status[1]"

in case if you finds any permission error then use the following commands.

```bash
sudo chmod +x pack_backup.opsrja
sudo chmod +x openlogs
./pack_backup.opsrja
```

if you encounters and path error then check out your terminal path.
if you encounters any other type of error then it may be because of broken backup which might be due to damage to OPSR-JA backup system by minecraft or by you. Check weather your OS supports Exeutable System of backup or not.

Once the backup is done rebrand and compress the resource pack and enjoy it again!.
